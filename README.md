## What It Does

FlowForge HR is a visual drag-and-drop HR workflow designer. HR admins can:

- **Design** workflows (onboarding, leave approval, document verification) by dragging nodes onto a canvas
- **Configure** each node with a dedicated, type-safe edit form
- **Validate** the graph structure in real-time (cycles, disconnected nodes, missing start/end)
- **Simulate** the workflow via a mock API and see a step-by-step execution log
- **Analyze** the workflow with AI (Anthropic Claude) for issues and improvement suggestions
- **Export / Import** workflows as JSON

---

## AI Feature — The Differentiator

When a workflow is designed, clicking **"Analyze with AI"** sends the serialized graph to the Anthropic Claude API. Claude returns:

- **Issues** — logical problems (e.g., approval with no predecessor task)
- **Suggestions** — improvements based on the workflow type
- **Summary** — a plain-English description of the entire workflow

This is **additive** — all spec requirements are met fully before the AI layer.

> **Note:** AI analysis requires an Anthropic API key. The mock API (simulate, automations) works without any key.

## How to Run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. (Optional) Enable AI analysis
cp .env.example .env.local
# Then add your Anthropic API key to .env.local:
# VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# 3. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173/**

## How to Manually Test (Step by Step)

### Basic Workflow

1. **Add a Start node** — drag "Start" from the left sidebar onto the canvas
2. **Add a Task node** — drag "Task" onto the canvas
3. **Add an Approval node** — drag "Approval" onto the canvas
4. **Add an End node** — drag "End" onto the canvas
5. **Connect them** — hover over a node's right edge handle (blue dot), then drag to the next node's left handle
6. **Delete** — select any node/edge and press `Delete`

### Configuring Nodes

7. **Click any node** — the right panel switches to the **Config** tab automatically
8. **Start node** — edit title and add optional metadata key-value pairs
9. **Task node** — fill in title, description, assignee name, due date, and custom fields
10. **Approval node** — select approver role (Manager / HRBP / Director), set auto-approve threshold
11. **Automated Step node** — choose an action from the dropdown (fetched from mock API), fill dynamic params
12. **End node** — set end message and toggle the summary flag

### Running Simulation

13. Switch to the **Simulate** tab in the right panel
14. Any validation errors (missing Start/End, cycles, disconnected nodes) are shown as a red banner
15. Click **Run Simulation** — the mock API returns a step-by-step execution log
16. Each step shows status (completed / pending / skipped), duration, and details

### AI Analysis

17. Switch to the **AI** tab in the right panel
18. Click **Analyze with AI**
19. If `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, Claude returns structured JSON with issues, suggestions, and a summary
20. If no key is set, a clear warning is shown

### Export / Import

21. Click the **↓ Download** icon in the canvas toolbar to export the workflow as `workflow.json`
22. Click the **↑ Upload** icon to import a JSON file and restore the workflow
23. Click **Fit View** (maximize icon) to center the restored graph

### Canvas Controls

24. **Zoom In/Out** — toolbar buttons or scroll wheel
25. **Minimap** — bottom-right corner of the canvas; colored by node type
26. **Clear** — trash icon in toolbar resets the canvas

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Zustand (not Redux or Context)?

React Flow triggers hundreds of re-renders during node dragging. Zustand's selector-based subscriptions prevent the form panel from re-rendering while the user drags a node. Context would cause the entire tree to re-render on every position update.

### Why MSW (not JSON Server)?

MSW intercepts `fetch()` calls at the browser level via a Service Worker. No separate server process is needed. The mock is realistic (real HTTP semantics) and disappears cleanly in production without any code change.

### Why Discriminated Union (not a flat `data: any`)?

```ts
type WorkflowNodeData = StartNodeData | TaskNodeData | ApprovalNodeData | ...
```

`NodeFormPanel` switches on `data.type` and TypeScript narrows to the exact interface. No `as any`, no optional fields everywhere. Adding a new node type means adding one interface, one form, and one case — the compiler enforces completeness.

### Why Direct Anthropic Fetch (not LangChain/Vercel AI)?

This is a frontend-only prototype. Adding a backend SDK just to call one API endpoint would be over-engineering. The direct `fetch()` keeps the bundle minimal and the flow transparent.

## What I'd Add With More Time

- **Undo/Redo** — Zustand `temporal` middleware (from `zundo`) wraps the store snapshot history
- **Auto-layout (Dagre)** — `@dagrejs/dagre` + React Flow's `elk` layout for one-click graph arrangement  
- **Node version history** — store a changelog array per node in the Zustand store
- **Streaming AI responses** — use Anthropic's streaming API + Server-Sent Events for real-time token output
- **E2E tests** — Playwright test for the core drag → configure → simulate flow
